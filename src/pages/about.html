                    I have a fascinating hobby that bridges the gap between technology and finance. I'm an avid enthusiast of algorithmic trading and have a particular fondness for developing trading bots using Pine Script, which is TradingView's proprietary coding language.

                    When I'm not immersed in the world of web development, you can often find me indulging in another thrilling passion â€“ sim racing. The roar of engines, the rush of competition, and the precision of every corner make this hobby an exhilarating escape.

                <p>
                    Sim racing allows me to combine my love for technology and my need for speed. I've built a dedicated racing rig, complete with a steering wheel, pedals, shifter, vr headset and a 4k oled monitor. Whether I'm tearing up virtual tracks in a Formula 1 car or battling it out in a GT sports car, the immersive experience is as close to real racing as it gets.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Sim racing is more than just a pastime; it's a testament to the fusion of technology and passion. It's a hobby that demands precision, strategy, and a deep understanding of racing dynamics.
